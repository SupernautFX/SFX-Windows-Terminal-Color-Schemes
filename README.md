# WInTerm-SFX-Color-Schemes
A Collection of all my own Custom Windows Terminal Color Schemes. A variety of stylistic choices are covered here, so whether you're looking for a dark theme, light theme, dark with pastel colors, light with washed out neon colors, dark with washed out gray-tone colors, light with bare bones basic default RGB colors, or something in between, or for THAT matter, ENTIRELY DIFFERENT, chances are you'll find at LEAST a handful of Schemes here that will fit your tastes, and no less than two or three that should, if to slightly varying degrees, match your exact specifications!
