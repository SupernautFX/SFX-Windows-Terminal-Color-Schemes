## About SFX Color Schemes

The included WT Color Schemes were crafted in a somewhat '**Structured**' manner. To *elaborate*: 

Not ONE of these Color Schemes were created 'at random'. Each one started its life with some form of a foundation, a sort of guideline which would be followed when time came to make each and every choice relevant to the Scheme. Every Dark and every Light Color Choice, every Accent (Cursor/Foreground/Background/Hightlight) Color Choice, whether or not to incorporate a background image (and whether that background was deemed necessary to tie the entire scheme together, or was simply more of an optional touch to enhance an otherwise already gorgeous scheme.), and so on, and so fourth. You'll find that **Every** (yes, *every*) Scheme **ALSO** has an assigned 'Font' that it was designed to compliment. Granted, *all but a few* of these fonts are simply among those featured in the **widely popular** [**Nerd Fonts Collection**](), with a few notable exceptions which use fonts from a *special variant* of the *Nerd Fonts* Font Families Collection, [**Powerline Fonts**](), which are essentially Nerd Fonts specialized for use with the [PowerShell Prompt Enhancement Module, Powerline](), which leverages the vast number of special glyphs included with select Nerd Fonts that cover a large variety of use cases, namely Git Status Glyphs, and Filetype Glyphs.

### Contact: Content (Claim of Ownership)

As always, I put great effort into this Project to ensure an acceptable, and enjoyable level of quality, with **heavy** emphasis on maintaining a **consistency of quality** throughout. Likewise, as this is one of my 'Creative Design' Projects, which often creates an environment wherein this issue becomes *far more relevant*, while I try to incorporate [*my own custom resources*]() wherever possible, there are a number of examples of resources, namely image resources, which have been sourced from third parties. In **all** such cases I have done my **best** to ensure all third party resources used were distributed with the intent that the content be open freely for use by others in their own separate Projects, namely sourcing them from Websites who host content for **this exact purpose**. Even still, whether it is requested by the Author/Poster/Distributor or not, I **always** do my **best** to provide a shoutout to give the creator/owner *some* form of Credit for the work, only omitting this occasionally when determining **who exactly to give credit to** is, to the best of my knowledge, and after going down every avenue I know of to try and discover the rightful recipient of credit, *seemingly* impossible. In which case I specify as much in place of crediting the creator. I am, however, not perfect, and in addition to resources/content with *Unknown Creators*, I am prone to providing Credit to the *wrong person/people*, and furthermore, it is *possible* that I may have borrowed a work I believed to be free to use, when that assumption is, in fact, **entirely inaccurate**. 

To Contact Me regarding **any** works, belonging to **You**, which may have been used in this Project, that you would like to recieve proper credit for, or rather, that you would prefer be removed/replaced, please contact my **Claims** email @ [sierracreative_copyclaims@outlook.com](mailto:sierracreative_copyclaims@outlook.com)

## About Me...

This Project was Designed/Developed by 'Nathaniel W. P.', AKA '[SupernautFX on GitHub](https://github.com/SupernautFX)'. I am **not**, by **any means**, a 'Professional' Software Engineer, IT Technician, Graphic Designer, Web Developer/Designer, nor anything else which *may* potentially afford me absolutely ANY degree of 'authority' on the subject(s) of, well, **anything** in my collection of [Personal Pet/Passion Projects hosted here on GitHub](https://github.com/SupernautFX?tab=repositories). I am merely a Hobbyist with *many*, **many** Loves and Passions in my life, chief of which just so happen to be Software Development, and Graphic Design (namely Iconography). 

That being said, if it hasn't *already* been made **Crystal Clear**, I am an absolutely, positively, **100% Self-Taught Novice**, at **BEST**. Everything I know I learned with nothing more *official* than installed copies of Visual Studio/VSCode, The Adobe Creative Cloud/Suite, and a '*healthy*' mix of [*DuckDuckGo*](https://duckduckgo.com/) searches, plus a steadily growing collection of *amazing* books authored by some folks who **ACTUALLY** know what they're talking about, covering all sorts of aspects of Software Development, and Digital Artwork and Design, *many of which are available for **free** online as e-books/PDFs*. All of which I *highly* recommend, and a **complete** list of every single one which I have discovered can be found here:
